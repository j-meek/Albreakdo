### Description of project goal: (e.g., the program will accomplish goal x.)

My program will be an interactive game that accomplishes the goal of teaching a basic concept of environmental biology.

### What task/goal will the project accomplish and why is this useful?

My program is a brick-break style game that teaches the user important fundamental concepts in the field of environmental science relating to albedo and climate change.

### What type of data/input will a user provide to the program?

Currently, the game works based on screentouch input which is able to move the paddle to reflect the ball.

### Where will the data come from?

All of the data in the program will come from the user as inputted screentouches which can tell the paddle where to go, change paddles, pause the game, or restart it.

### How will a user interact with the program?

The user will interact with the program through their computer or phone using touch based input to start the game, control the paddle, swap paddles, pause the game, and restart the game. To play the user will most likely simply have to download the game which will be a package which includes all of the art assets and code to function.

### What type of output will the program produce (e.g., text, plots)?

The program outputs a user-friendly interface which controls the GUI for playing a fun educational game. Examples of output the user will see can include text displaying controls and objectives for winning, art assets such as clouds, a sun, a ball, and paddles, an updating score, and buttons to pause/restart.

### What other tools currently exist to do this task, or something similar?

There are many other brick breaking games that exist that are similar to this however not many take an educational approach. My program will be different as it attempts to hopefully teach the user about climate change and albedo along the way of playing a fun game.
