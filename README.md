# project

### Description of project goal: (e.g., the program will accomplish goal x.)

My program will be an interactive game that accomplishes the goal of teaching a basic concept of environmental biology
    
### Description of the code: (e.g., what packages you will use, or classes you will create.)

I am not sure exactly how it works, however I have heard of a package called pygame which I beleive will be incredibly useful for this project

### Description of the data: (e.g., it will analyze CSV data input by the user.)

I will present my own data for teaching purposes

### Description or demonstration of user interaction: (e.g., see example below.)

User will open the game (depending on how large the game is maybe it can run from the CLI? Or maybe the user will have to download it to their computer?)
The game will be designed with a user friendly interface displaying controls and objectives for winning, hopefully learning something along the way
