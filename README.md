# Albreakdo

My program is a brick-break style game that teaches the user important fundamental concepts in the field of environmental science relating to albedo and climate change.

Mechanics/ideas still missing:

- Game is on a timer to break all blocks
- Breakable blocks for points
- Some breakable blocks will represent greenhouse gas blocks
- Greenhouse blocks that are destroyed speed up the timer and make the screen redder and redder (warming up the planet) until player loses game
- Player can change paddle color, each color has its own reflectivity (speeds up/slows down ball velocity)
- Colors in order of most to least reflectivity: white, sand, green, blue
### In Development

> kivy installation: 'conda install kivy -c conda-forge' -- otherwise see instructions at https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html


> git clone https://github.com/lili4127/AlbreakdoGame.git


> cd ./Albreakdo/src


> python main.py (for now. once game is completed it will be deployed, downloaded, and run so no pip install)
